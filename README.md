# Custom Ping Sound
Simple Lethal Company sound mod that let's you replace the radar ping sound with any custom .wav file. If you're looking for reference on how to implement or use similar audio loading you can check out both branches on github. Other branch has an alternative way of loading files if the normal way doesn't work on your end.

## Installation

Install like any other BepInEx mod. You can get a built version of the mod from the github releases page. This mod requires the following API for it to function properly: https://github.com/no00ob/LCSoundTool. Install to the following directory:

```
  \GAME_LOCATION\Lethal Company\BepInEx\plugins
```
The sound is located within the subdirectory that has the same name as the DLL file. Do not rename this folder as it will break the mod. You can replace this sound file with any sound of your choosing, just keep the name as ping.wav for the mod to function correctly.
